To replicate Bash's behavior and correctly handle empty quotes (`''` or `""`) when implementing your control logic, your approach should account for the following rules:

---

### **Rules for Handling Empty Quotes in `echo`**
1. **Empty Quotes Between Words**:
   - If `''` or `""` appears between words with spaces around them, **do nothing** because the space is already provided by the surrounding context.

   Example:
   ```
   echo hello '' world
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   hello  world
   ```
   (Notice the double spaces between `hello` and `world` due to the empty argument.)

2. **Empty Quotes at the End**:
   - If `''` or `""` appears at the end and there are no words after, **add a space** because the empty argument needs to be represented.

   Example:
   ```
   echo hello ''
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   hello
   ```

3. **Empty Quotes at the Beginning**:
   - If `''` or `""` appears at the beginning and thereâ€™s no preceding word, **add a space** if there are words after.

   Example:
   ```
   echo '' hello
   ```
   Output:
   ```
    hello
   ```

4. **Consecutive Empty Quotes**:
   - If there are consecutive empty quotes (`'' ''`), each counts as a separate argument, and a single space separates them.

   Example:
   ```
   echo '' ''
   ```
   Output:
   ```
    <space>
   ```

### **Control Logic**

Hereâ€™s how you can handle these cases programmatically:

#### **Step 1: Parse Input**
- Split the input into words while keeping quotes intact.
- Track the context (whether a word or space appears before or after the empty quotes).

#### **Step 2: Apply Rules**
- For each token:
  1. If itâ€™s an empty quote (`''` or `""`):
     - If thereâ€™s a word before and after: **do nothing** (retain existing spaces).
     - If itâ€™s at the end of the line: **add a space** after the last word.
     - If itâ€™s at the start of the line: **add a space** before the first word.
     - If there are consecutive empty quotes: Treat each as a separate space.

- For non-empty words, add them to the result as-is.

### **Pseudocode**
Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode for implementing this:

```pseudo
function handle_empty_quotes(input):
    tokens = split_input(input)  # Split input by spaces, keeping quotes intact
    result = []
    previous_token = None

    for token in tokens:
        if token == "''" or token == '""':  # Empty quotes
            if previous_token is None:  # Start of line
                result.append(" ")
            elif previous_token == " ":  # Consecutive spaces or quotes
                result.append(" ")
            # If it's in the middle of other words, do nothing (space already implied)
        else:
            # Add non-empty words to the result
            result.append(token)

        # Update the previous token
        previous_token = token

    return join_with_spaces(result)
```

### **Implementation Example in C**

Hereâ€™s how you might implement this logic in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void handle_empty_quotes(char *input) {
    char *tokens = strtok(input, " ");
    char *previous_token = NULL;

    while (tokens) {
        if (strcmp(tokens, "''") == 0 || strcmp(tokens, "\"\"") == 0) {
            // Handle empty quotes
            if (previous_token == NULL) {
                printf(" ");  // Start of line
            } else if (strcmp(previous_token, " ") == 0) {
                printf(" ");  // Consecutive spaces
            }
        } else {
            // Print non-empty words
            printf("%s", tokens);
        }

        // Print a space between tokens
        printf(" ");
        previous_token = tokens;
        tokens = strtok(NULL, " ");
    }

    printf("\n");
}
```

### **Example Input and Output**

#### Input:
```bash
echo hello '' hello
```

#### Output:
```
hello  hello
```

---

#### Input:
```bash
echo '' hello
```

#### Output:
```
 hello
```

---

#### Input:
```bash
echo hello ''
```

#### Output:
```
hello
```

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Check the context of empty quotes (`''` or `""`) in relation to surrounding words.
- Add spaces only when needed:
  - At the start or end of the input.
  - Between consecutive empty quotes.
- Keep spaces implied by the surrounding context intact.
